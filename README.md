Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their popular mobile game Draw It or Lose It to an online platform. Currently available as an Android app, the game involves teams competing to guess drawings created from a library of stock photos. Players have a limited time to make a correct guess, and if no team succeeds, other teams can try to solve the puzzle. The client sought software development to adapt the game for online play, maintaining its interactive and competitive elements while ensuring it could function seamlessly in a web environment.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was very good at giving a clear and succinct overview of the client's demands and the software requirements when I was creating the documentation for The Gaming Room's project. By concentrating on the main components of the project—the conversion of *Draw It or Lose It* from an Android mobile app to an online platform while maintaining the original gaming mechanics—I made sure the main points were understandable. I also emphasized the game's competitive aspect, in which teams must estimate artwork from stock pictures and compete by solving problems in a set amount of time. I was able to produce documentation that conveyed the project by logically organizing the data and highlighting the client's key objective, which was to modify the game for online play without sacrificing user experience.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were able to make one revision to the documentation, it would be to include a more thorough explanation of the technical requirements for moving the game from a mobile app to an internet platform. I could enhance the part by including more details regarding the online infrastructure required to handle multiplayer features, real-time interactions, and cloud integration, even though I clearly described the client's objectives and the game mechanics. I would make it better by briefly discussing the technical elements, including server architecture, database administration for user information and game progress, and possible scalability issues. This would align the expectations of the stakeholders about technical obstacles and resource requirements, in addition to providing a clearer picture of the project's complexity. This would give the customer and the development team a better understanding of the entire project's scope and any potential roadblocks to the game's online release.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By concentrating on preserving the essential gameplay components that contributed to the success of the mobile app—such as timed drawing and guessing, team-based competition, and puzzle-solving—I was able to understand the demands of the users when creating the online version of Draw It or Lose It for The Gaming Room. With a focus on real-time multiplayer capabilities to facilitate quick team interactions, I made sure that these elements were maintained in the web version. I also took into account the necessity of scalability and accessibility, ensuring that the game would function properly on a variety of devices and accommodate a range of player counts. To ensure both functioning and engagement, software design must take user needs into account. This is because the final product must match what consumers expect and enjoy. I made a smooth and entertaining experience that adhered to the game's original premise while modifying it for an online platform by focusing the design on the preferences of the users. This strategy encourages sustained engagement and happiness in addition to meeting user expectations.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I focused on scalability, technical viability, and user experience when creating the online edition of Draw It or Lose It. I started by making sure that the fundamental gaming elements—like timed drawing, group guessing, and real-time competition—were maintained while being modified for an online setting. I would improve this strategy for the next software applications by implementing an agile methodology for continuous improvement, wireframing, prototyping for early visualization, and user story mapping to better understand user demands. To guarantee scalability and flexibility as user demand increases, I would also take into account cloud-based services and microservices design. Future software projects could benefit from more effective and efficient software design thanks to the combination of user-focused design and contemporary development techniques.
